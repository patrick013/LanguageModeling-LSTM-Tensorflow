No matter where you may go, don't forget to write to me.
I must go there irrespective of what you think.
You should have nothing to complain about.
No wonder you could not open the door.

I can't work with you standing there.
By the time you got there, the sun had set.
You gave me a real surprise when you showed up there.
Since you say so.
You may well say so, but I cannot agree.
There is no reason why you shouldn't do such a thing.

I didn't expect you to turn up here.
There is no need for you to stay here.
As long as you're here, I'll stay.
With you here beside me I'm not afraid of anything. You're my fortress.
The watch you gave me doesn't keep time.
I had no notion that you were coming.
My life would be completely empty without you.
You will be missed by your friends.
We shall all miss you when you go away.
I miss you badly.
How I miss you.
I miss you very much.
